st.title("Analyzing Heavy Metal Contamination in River Samples from Illegal Mining Areas")
st.markdown("""
Illegal mining activities, commonly referred to as *galamsey*, have led to the widespread contamination of water bodies in Ghana. This article-style dashboard explores the presence of heavy metals in river water and the potential health and environmental risks they pose. All analyses are based on real field data and aligned with WHO guidelines.

# INTRODUCTION
st.header("Introduction")
st.markdown("""
Mining, though economically beneficial, can lead to significant environmental damage when done illegally. Rivers near mining zones are often exposed to heavy metals such as **Arsenic, Lead, Cadmium**, and **Chromium**, which can severely affect human and aquatic life.

This report examines:
- The concentration levels of heavy metals
- Whether they exceed WHO permissible limits
- Clustering patterns of contamination
- Health Pollution Index (HPI)
- Proposed mitigation strategies
""")

# METHODOLOGY
st.header("Methodology")
st.markdown("""
Data was collected from multiple river sources in mining areas. Each sample was tested for several parameters including:
- **Heavy metals**: Arsenic, Cadmium, Chromium, Lead
- **Water quality**: pH, TDS, Hardness

We applied:
- **Descriptive analytics**
- **KMeans clustering**
- **HPI scoring system**
- **Visual exploration** using histograms and heatmaps

# SOLUTIONS
st.header("Mitigation Strategies")

To tackle the environmental damage caused by illegal mining:
- **Strengthen enforcement** of environmental laws
- **Implement real-time water monitoring systems**
- **Educate communities** on the impact of illegal mining
- **Encourage sustainable mining practices**
- **Restore vegetation and natural water flow paths**

# CONCLUSION

This analysis reveals that many water samples contain heavy metals beyond safe limits, particularly **Chromium** and **Lead**. Immediate actions are needed to control pollution, protect lives, and restore affected ecosystems.
