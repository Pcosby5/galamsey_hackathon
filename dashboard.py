This analysis explores the impact of illegal mining (galamsey) on river water quality, focusing on heavy metal contamination. Using samples from affected water bodies, we evaluated concentrations of Arsenic, Cadmium, Chromium, and Lead‚Äîcomparing them to WHO permissible limits.

**Key Findings**:
- **Chromium** displayed the widest concentration spread, suggesting inconsistent contamination likely due to localized mining hotspots.
- **Cadmium** levels were generally low, but several samples still exceeded safe limits.
- Both **Lead** and **Arsenic** were moderately present, with over 60% of samples surpassing WHO guidelines‚Äîindicating persistent health risks.

The **Heavy Metal Pollution Index (HPI)** was computed to assess cumulative toxicity. Samples were categorized into **low**, **medium**, and **high** risk groups. A significant number of samples fell into the **high-risk** category, confirming urgent environmental health concerns.

Using unsupervised **KMeans clustering**, we identified distinct patterns of contamination. This clustering helps pinpoint severely affected zones for targeted intervention.

A **correlation analysis** showed strong positive relationships between some metal concentrations, suggesting shared contamination sources‚Äîlikely linked to illegal mining discharges.

**Recommendations**:
- **Strengthen monitoring and enforcement** to halt illegal mining activities.
- **Rehabilitate polluted sites** using affordable eco-remediation technologies.
- **Educate local communities** on the risks of contaminated water and promote safe alternatives.
- **Invest in sustainable livelihoods** to reduce dependence on illegal mining.

This dashboard provides an interactive tool for policymakers, researchers, and NGOs to visualize water quality threats and drive impactful decisions toward water safety and public health.
